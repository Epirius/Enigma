it does not work, i think there is something wrong with the letter when it goes back through the rotor the second time. 
as in it goes through rotor 1, 2 and 3. but when it returns back through 3, 2 and 1 there is a problem.
i think the problem is that it goes through the rotor front to back, even when returning.
it should go front to back for the first 3, and when returning it should go back to front.
